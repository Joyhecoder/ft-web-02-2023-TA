1. What is string interpolation in JavaScript?

string interpolation in js is a process in which an expression is inserted or placed in the string.
To insert or embed this expression into the string a template literal is used. By using string interpolation in js, values like variables and mathematical expressions and calculations acan also be added. 

Example:
let num1 = 5
let num2 = 6
console.log(`The product of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${num1 + num2}`)



2. What is the syntax for string interpolation in JavaScript?

`string where interpolation should be done enclosed in backticks: expression`


3. How does string interpolation differ from string concatenation?

String interpolation does not need a + to concate two string, and it saves time, and it also allow dynamic code. 


4. Can you use variables in string interpolation?
Yes

5. Can you use expressions in string interpolation?
Yes

6. What is the difference between single and double quotes when using string interpolation?


The essential difference between the two literal forms of strings( single or double quotes) is that double quotes allow for escape sequences while single quotes do not.

Example: 
"\n" # will be interpreted as a new line
'\n' # will just print out \n


7. Can you use string interpolation with template literals?
Yes, string interpolation is commonly used with template literals. In fact, string interpolation is one of the main features of template literals in many programming languages.

In JavaScript, for example, template literals are enclosed in backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes, and string interpolation is performed using the ${expression} syntax. 


8. How do you escape characters in string interpolation?
The backslash is used to indicate that the character immediately following it should be treated as a literal character rather than a special character with a special meaning in the context of the string.

For example, in JavaScript, if you want to include a double quote character (") inside a string that is enclosed in double quotes, you can escape the double quote character using a backslash like this:

let message = "She said, \"Hello!\"";
console.log(message);  => She said, "Hello!"


9. Can you use string interpolation in older versions of JavaScript?
It was introduced in ES6, any version before that won't be able to use template literals for string interpolation.

10. How can you use string interpolation in a function or method?
You can use string interpolation in a function or method by including the interpolated string expression inside the function or method body, using the ${expression} syntax.

For example, here's a function in JavaScript that uses string interpolation to generate a greeting message:

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Alice"));
